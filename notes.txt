> HTTP is a standardised protocol used to communicate back and forth between a frontend and a backend.

> The frontend sends an HTTP request to backend(usually consists of URL, method, header and body), then the
    backend processes the request, and sends a HTTP response back to the frontend(usually consists of headers 
    and body), which can be used by the frontend to update the UI.
